    3 types of Tests:

        UNIT TEST:
            Test one specific function on a class.
            Fake any needed database connections.
        INTEGRATION TEST:
            Just Like a unit test Except it uses the real database connection!
        FUNCTIONAL TEST:
            Write a test to programmatically command a browser.

    How much should I be testing my code??!!!!!:

        Does every function need a unit test? Does every page and every validation error of
        every form need a functional test? Absolutely not! That sounds worse than a raptor
        claw across a chalkboard!

        Especially if you're new to testing, a few tests is way better than none. And honestly,
        I think many people create too many tests. I follow a simple rule; if it scares me,
        I test it.
        Too many tests:
            - take extra time,
            - add little value,
            - and slow you down later when they fail after you've made a minor change.

    Test-Driven Development or TDD:

        TDD breaks coding into three steps:
            First, create the test.
            Second, write the minimum amount of code to get that test to pass.
            And third, now that your tests are passing, you can safely refactor your code to make it fancier.

    phpunit_cli:
        command1: 'phpunit -h'
            desc: 'show the help'
        command2: 'phpunit --debug'
            desc: 'run the tests with the debug mode'
        command3: 'phpunit --filter the_test_name'
            desc: 'run only one test'
        command4: 'phpunit --filter the_test_name --debug'
            desc: 'runs one test in the debug mode'
        command5: "phpunit --filter test_name 'test_name #test_case_index' --debug"
            desc: 'if test has data provider you kann run one data set by definning it #test_case_index after the test name but between singl quates in command'
        command6: "phpunit --filter test_name 'test_name @test_cast_special_name' --debug"
            desc: 'if test has data provider you kann run one data case by definning it #test_case_name after the test name but between singl quates in command'
        command7: 'phpunit --stope-on-failure --stop-on-error'
            desc: 'stop the tests if failure or error occurs not run the test after them'
        command8: 'phpunit --testsuite suite_name --debug'
            desc: 'runs only the tests under this suite name'
            note: 'the suite name should be configured in the phpunit.xml.dist file suite+directory'

##### Integration Tests ####
        notes:
            - Test classes should extends the KernelTestCase
            - in tests boot the symfony kernel using self::bootKernel()
            - get the symfony container to get the services you need to test.
                slef::$kernel->getContainer()->get(service_name)
            - - error(You have requested a non-existent service): because the services in container are
                private, you need to confgiure them public in the test environment.
            - - sulotion:
                    - open app/config/config_test.yml
                    - under services key add default and public to true,then create service alias
                    services:
                        _defaults:
                            public: true

                        test.the_service_id: '@the_service_id'

##### Clearing the Database #####
        notes_2:
            symfony4: you should add config/packages/test/doctrine.yaml
            symfony3: in config_test.yml add the following
                doctrine:
                    dbal:
                        url: 'sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/var/data/test.sqlite'
                        whysqlite:
                            - simple to set up.
                            - use some tricks to speed your test.
            tip1:
                use_fixtures: composer require doctrine/data-fixtures --dev
                why_use_fixtures: it has an entity purger, make nice,
                but: if you have two entites that have forign key refering to each other may cause a problem.
                and: use this purger in the test setUp so the  purge database before every test

    Testing_a_class_logic:
        does_this_class_scare_me: dont test simple classes
        can_I_unit_test_this_class: if I mock all dependencies is the logic still testable
        class_can_not_be_unit_tested: go for integration test
